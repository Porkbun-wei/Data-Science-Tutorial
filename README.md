# Data Science Tutorial

Tutorials related to data analytics, machine learning, or statistics. I am working on the online MS degree in Analytics from Georgia Tech. I want to create some tutorials as I learn different techniques. 

The tutorial will serve as a good study materials in my future career. 

All tutorials will either be in Jupyter Notebook or Rmarkdown format unless otherwise specified.

1. Python Linear Regression Tutorial.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook contains tutorial for performing simple linear regression using Matrix Algebra method and sklearn library

2. Visualizing Correlation Coefficient in Python.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook contains a short tutorial for visualizing coefficient coefficient using pandas and seaborn.

3. Bayes Theorem Example.pdf is a pdf file that covers the mathametical derivation of Bayes' Theorem. The applications of Bayes' Theorem for some common interview questions are covered, such as the Monty Hall Problem. The answers to this problems are derived mathmatically.
