# Data_Tutorial
Tutorials related to data analytics, machine learning, or statistics. I am working on the online MS degree in Analytics from Georgia Tech. I want to create some tutorials as I learn different techniques. 

The tutorial will serve as a good study materials in my future career.   

All tutorials will either be in Jupyter Notebook or Rmarkdown format unless otherwise specified.
