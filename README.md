# Data Science Tutorial

Tutorials related to data analytics, machine learning, or statistics. I am working on the online MS degree in Analytics from Georgia Tech. I want to create some tutorials as I learn different techniques. 

The tutorial will serve as a good study materials in my future career. 

All tutorials will either be in Jupyter Notebook or Rmarkdown format unless otherwise specified.

1. Python Linear Regression Tutorial.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook contains tutorial for performing simple linear regression using Matrix Algebra method and sklearn library

2. Decision tree and RandomForest from scratch in Python. Further editing needed.
